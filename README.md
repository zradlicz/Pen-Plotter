# Pen Plotter
I designed and built a Pen Plotter to plot generative art. This document is mostly for me in case I waant to come back and improve my design, so I won't go into detail on assembly or how to actually get it working. Feel free to use the STLs to print your own. I will warn you some of the hole sizes are too small for the harware and shafts, and a lot of dremel work was required to get it to fit together. I lost my Inventor liscense before I got to make improvements, so I'm just calling this project finished.

## Example Work

## List of Design Improvements
- Pen Holder is too thin and has to much deflection in Y direction  
- Wires get in the way during printing  
- Design electronics box  
- Use set screws to hold shafts in place rather than press fit
